# Enhanced Redactable Blockchain with Smart Contract Support

## Overview

This enhanced implementation of the Redaction_Ateniese benchmark extends the original chameleon hash-based redactable blockchain to support smart contracts and permissioned blockchain features, implementing concepts from the paper "Data Redaction in Smart-Contract-Enabled Permissioned Blockchains".

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Smart Contract Support

- **Smart Contract Model**: Full smart contract lifecycle support including deployment, execution, and state management
- **Contract Types**: Support for various contract types including audit contracts, privacy compliance contracts, and general-purpose contracts
- **Transaction Types**: Enhanced transaction model supporting:
  - Regular transfers
  - Smart contract calls
  - Smart contract deployments
  - Redaction requests

### 2. Permissioned Blockchain Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Five distinct roles with different permission levels:
  - `ADMIN` (Level 100): Full permissions including deployment and redaction
  - `REGULATOR` (Level 80): Audit, redaction, and approval permissions
  - `MINER` (Level 60): Mining, validation, and read permissions
  - `USER` (Level 40): Transaction and read permissions
  - `OBSERVER` (Level 20): Read-only permissions

### 3. Advanced Redaction Policies

- **Policy-Based Redaction**: Configurable redaction policies with conditions and approval requirements
- **Multiple Redaction Types**:
  - `DELETE`: Complete removal of transaction data
  - `MODIFY`: Modification of transaction content
  - `ANONYMIZE`: Anonymization of sensitive fields
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-signature approval process for redaction requests

### 4. Privacy and Compliance Features

- **Privacy Levels**: Transaction privacy classification (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL)
- **Data Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention periods
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all redaction operations
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of privacy policies

    "ADMIN": 100,
    "REGULATOR": 80,
    "MINER": 60,
    "USER": 40,
    "OBSERVER": 20
}

```

#### Privacy and Compliance Parameters

```python
hasPrivacyLevels = True           # Enable privacy level classification
dataRetentionPeriod = 86400 * 365 # Data retention period (1 year)
requireRedactionApproval = True   # Require approval for redactions
minRedactionApprovals = 2         # Minimum approvals for redaction
```

```python
REDACTION_POLICIES = [
    {
        "policy_id": "GDPR_COMPLIANCE",
        "policy_type": "DELETE",
        "conditions": {"privacy_request": True, "data_expired": True},
        "authorized_roles": ["ADMIN", "REGULATOR"],
        "min_approvals": 2,
        "time_lock": 86400  # 24 hours
    },
    # Additional policies...
]
```

## Usage

### Running the Enhanced Simulation

```python
python Main.py
```

The enhanced simulation will:

1. Initialize role-based permissions for all nodes
2. Deploy initial smart contracts (audit and privacy contracts)
3. Generate mixed transaction types including smart contract calls
4. Process redaction requests with approval workflows
5. Execute smart contracts and track state changes
6. Generate comprehensive statistics and reports

### Transaction Mix

- 80% Regular transfers
- 10% Smart contract calls
- 5% Smart contract deployments
- 5% Redaction requests

### Output and Reports

The enhanced simulation generates detailed Excel reports with multiple sheets:

#### Standard Sheets

- `InputConfig`: Simulation configuration parameters
- `SimOutput`: Block and transaction statistics
- `Chain`: Final blockchain state
- `ChainBeforeRedaction`: Blockchain state before redactions

#### Enhanced Sheets

- `SmartContracts`: Detailed smart contract call logs
- `ContractSummary`: Smart contract deployment and execution statistics
- `PermissionStats`: Permission and redaction statistics including:
  - Total redaction requests and approvals
  - Redaction breakdown by type and role
  - Average redaction processing time

#### Statistics Tracked

- Smart contract deployments and calls
- Redaction requests, approvals, and rejections
- Permission violations and policy enforcements
- Privacy level distribution
- Audit trail completeness

## Key Features Demonstration

### 1. Smart Contract Lifecycle

```python
# Contract deployment by authorized node
contract_address = admin.deploy_contract(contract_code, "AUDIT")

# Contract call execution
contract_call = ContractCall(
    contract_address=contract_address,
    function_name="requestRedaction",
    parameters=[block_id, tx_id, "Privacy compliance"],
    caller=str(user.id)
)
```

### 2. Redaction Request Workflow

```python
# User requests redaction
request_id = user.request_redaction(
    target_block=5,
    target_tx=2,
    redaction_type="DELETE",
    reason="GDPR compliance"
)

# Authorized nodes vote on the request
regulator.vote_on_redaction(request_id, True, "Approved for compliance")
admin.vote_on_redaction(request_id, True, "Privacy rights respected")
```

### 3. Policy Enforcement

```python
# Check redaction policy compliance
if BlockCommit.check_redaction_policy(transaction, "DELETE", "REGULATOR"):
    # Execute redaction
    BlockCommit.execute_approved_redaction(request, block, timestamp)
```

## Research Applications

This enhanced implementation enables research into:

1. **Smart Contract Privacy**: How smart contracts can manage and enforce privacy policies in redactable blockchains
2. **Permissioned Redaction**: The effectiveness of role-based access control for redaction operations
3. **Compliance Automation**: Automated enforcement of regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
4. **Redaction Governance**: Multi-party approval mechanisms for sensitive data redaction
5. **Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts that can selectively redact their own data
6. **Audit and Accountability**: Comprehensive audit trails for redaction operations in enterprise blockchains

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced implementation includes optimizations for:

- Efficient permission checking with role-based caching
- Lazy evaluation of smart contract state
- Batch processing of redaction requests
- Optimized voting mechanisms for large networks

## Future Extensions

Potential areas for further enhancement:

- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving redactions
- Cross-chain redaction protocols
- Machine learning-based automatic redaction detection
- Integration with external compliance frameworks
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives

## Compliance and Standards

The implementation supports compliance with:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- Custom enterprise privacy policies

This enhanced benchmark provides a comprehensive foundation for researching redactable blockchains in enterprise and regulated environments where smart contracts and permissioned access are essential requirements.
