## Research Contributions

This implementation enables research into:

1. **Smart Contract Privacy Management**
   - How smart contracts can enforce privacy policies
   - Automated compliance monitoring through contracts
   - Privacy-preserving smart contract architectures

2. **Permissioned Redaction Governance**
   - Multi-party approval mechanisms for sensitive operations
   - Role-based access control for redaction operations
   - Policy-driven automated redaction

3. **Enterprise Blockchain Privacy**
   - GDPR/HIPAA compliance in blockchain systems
   - Selective data redaction in permissioned networks
   - Audit trail maintenance during redaction operations

4. **Smart Contract Redactability**
   - Redactable smart contract state management
   - Policy-based contract data modification
   - Compliance-driven contract behavior

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimized Permission Checking**: Role-based caching for efficient access control
- **Batch Redaction Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple redaction requests
- **Smart Contract Execution**: Gas-limited execution with performance monitoring
- **Statistical Tracking**: Minimal overhead statistics collection

## Usage Instructions

### Running Standard Simulation

```bash
cd Redaction_Ateniese
python Main.py
```

### Running Enhanced Tests

```bash
cd Redaction_Ateniese
python test_enhanced_features.py
